# How to create an accessable and inclusive design.
For a certain course in the minor webdevelopment I created an website with mostly purely CSS. The purpose of this website was to create something fun, unique, crazy and just letting your creativity flow. And ofcourse educating yourself in the art that is CSS, which proved to be more difficult than I had originally anticipated. While that was all fun and games and I created something I was actually quite proud of, I need touch the subject of UX, accessability and inclusivity. Because interaction design is a subject I only briefly touched while I creating this website, but it could be more meaningfull for everybody when diving deeper into these subjects.

## Accessability and Inclusive Design 
Inclusive design means you create something for different users, where you will automatically run into the matter of accessability. To create a website that is accessable you will also make it more inclusive, which is great! The internet for everybody and so your website should also be for everybody. Although this is not always managable in the workfield, it is still good to wrap your head around it from time to time. The problem with accessability mostly comes down to the following:

### Animations
Personally I love animations, they add such a fun an creative aspect to an website. Plus they're fun to make! But there is a big but in this equation.
