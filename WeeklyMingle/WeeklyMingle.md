# Weekly mingle
**During the minor we visted an agency every week, to learn about the workfield, different companies and ofcourse mingle! I really enjoyed these weeks to learn about different company dynamics, their work ethic and the different projects they take on!**

## Mirabeau 
So this was our first company. The first impressions were very good! They have various projects spread throughout the building. The presentation was mainly about Mirabeau and the projects that they have done. Like Transavia and KLM, specifically picking your airplane chair in the layout of an actual airplane! Which I thought was pretty cool. Further it went on about the merging of two companies: Mirabeau and Cognizant. However the work positions did feel kinda stiff, when you are a frontend developer you are only ever a developer. 

## Q42
Well, obviously I did see the slide, but let’s move on! The people that did the presentation were prepared and the mood was very pleasant. I really liked that they reserved time during work hours for your own special project. So you can practise new techniques, maybe even together with a co-worker, to improve your skills while not taking up too much free time outside the office like most companies. Resulting in night-work and a sleepy head in the office. And they orchestrated user tests with the product-owner etc. Which I have never heard of in a company and we all know how important testing is. They also had a flat hierarchy which I also really liked.

## Matise
I really liked this place! Not too big, just the right amount of people to get shit done! They used to have many project managers, but want to evolve to a structure where everyone is able to code and still do other things, so everyone is on the same page. We  also had a little brainstorm session for a project they have been working on, which was actually really difficult given the amount of time but fun nonetheless. I also really liked how they take on a new project, research, building small prototypes and essentially showing the product-owner that the things they want are not what they are looking for. And then building cool stuff. 

## ICATT 
Everyone at the table had a different function within the company. We had a backend developer, frontend developer, designer and founder. Everyone explained their different function and the designer showed some stuff she had been working on. Then we had to do a pitch ourselves, which I found hard and made me realise I definitely need to figure out what I want to do and work on my pitch! 

## Lifely
Sadly this week I was in Edinburgh, so I didn’t get to see Lifely as a company. However the owner Peter Peerdeman did give some lectures at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences about React and one during project Tech, which were really awesome!  

## Dept
Very big company! Though the energy felt very chill. They use a lot of techniques I really like working with and have a lot of fun projects they’re working on. Another thing I really liked is that they work internationally, however this might also complicate things sometimes. They also have three kind of different front-end developers so they can really specialise themselves in one area: creative developers, technical and those who are really specialised in frameworks and vanilla js. This made me realize I really want to get to do the creative side of frontend development.

## Elastique 
Before going to this company one of our teachers told me this might be a company I would really like, because even though you are a frontend developer you still get to participate in the whole process of creating a concept for a project. Which is kinda what i’m looking for because five days on end programming, will probably drive me mad. Bit of an exaggeration there, but you get the gist. I was not dissapointed, because the people there also confirmed this! We also learned about marshmallows in projects: the one thing that might seem easy, but will actually take up a lot of your time or completely ruin your project. I did feel like they had a lot more backend developers here though.

## Valtech_
Last but not least the final weekly mingle! First they introduced the company again and their projects. I had no idea Valtech_ was that big, with really cool project partners and their spread around the globe! Every country is specialised is some kind of technique which I find really cool! After this we got a presentation about the bluetooth API. During frontend united someone briefly touched this topic, but the possibility’s are endless and it’s really cool to make IOT products with. So that definitely gave their presentation a fun little twist and was really awesome to learn something about.
